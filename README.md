# The Octopus style guide

Everybody at Octopus writes whether it's documentation, blog posts, CLI help text, marketing copy, pitches, or text within the product itself. This guide aims to be a useful resource to serve as a quick reference to keep us consistent whenever we're unsure about how to write a piece of text.

The style guide includes the following sections:

- [Markdown quick reference](markdown-quick-reference)
- [Blog templates](blog-templates/readme.md)
