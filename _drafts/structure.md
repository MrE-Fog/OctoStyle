When creating new documentation, you should structure it as follows:

1. Introduction.

  Provide an introduction that explains what the documentation covers and provide some sample scenarios for when users might want to implement it. For instance:

  > This document explains how to install Octopus Deploy for fast, reliable, repeatable deployments.

2. Procedural.

  Next, walk the user through the process you're describing with easy to follow step-by-step instructions. Try to focus on the most common use cases and provide a direct path the user can follow to achieve the goal of the procedure.

  > 1. Select Projects from the main navigation, and click ADD PROJECT.
  > 2. Give the project a name that's meaningful to you, and anybody else who'll work on the project.
  > 3. ...

3. Reference/advanced used cases, FAQs

  If there are lists of parameters or additional options available, provide the details in a list or table for easy access after the procedural content. If there are common troubleshooting steps users might need to perform, list them here.

4. Next.

  Provide links to related documentation, the blog, or other resources to help the reader continue their journey.
