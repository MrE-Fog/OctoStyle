Not everybody who reads the Octopus Deploy documentation is a native English speaker with a degree in computer science, though many are. To make the documentation as widely accessible as possible we recommend:

- Address the reader directly by writing in second person. Imagine you are talking to the reader.
- Use an informal tone and simple, declarative language.
- Define technical terms the reader might not be familiar with.
- Use simple sentence structures to avoid overloading the reader with too much information all at once.
- Use US English spelling.
- Try to anticipate why somebody would read the documentation and the types of problems they are trying to solve. Instead of describing features, explain what users can do with them and how they do it.
- Avoid overly formal language or an academic style.
- Avoid slang, colloquialisms, and other terms the reader might not be familiar with.
