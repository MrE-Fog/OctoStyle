Not everybody who interacts with Octopus Deploy or reads our words is a native English speaker with a degree in computer science, though many are. To make our communication as widely accessible as possible we recommend:

## Voice

- Use US English spelling.
- Address the reader directly by writing in second person. Imagine you are talking to the reader. i.e., _To configure X, you need to do Y._
- Use simple sentence structures to avoid overloading the reader with too much information all at once.
- Avoid overly formal language or an academic style, and use simple, declarative language.
- Avoid slang, colloquialisms, and other terms the reader might not be familiar with.

## Style

- Use sentence case for titles and only capitalize words that would normally be capitalized.
- Define technical terms the reader might not be familiar with.
- Try to anticipate the types of problems your reader is trying to solve. In documentation, instead of describing features, explain how the feature can solve the user's problem.
