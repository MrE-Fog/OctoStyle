## Screenshots 

When you're demonstrating how to complete a task in a UI, screenshots can be incredibly useful. When used well they reassure users they’re on the right path and make following the steps a frictionless process. However, it is important not to over-rely on screenshots as UIs change and users can be left confused when the screenshot doesn't match the UI.

To help get the balance right, think of screenshots as signposts along the way. Don’t include screenshots for every step of a procedure, but to orient the user if:

- They might struggle to locate an item in the UI.
- The procedure jumps from one place in the UI to another.
- You want to reassure them they’re in the right place.
- For accessibility reasons, it’s also important not to rely solely on screenshots to convey information to users. When including screenshots, please also describe the actions you expect the user to take.

Make sure any information that is conveyed in the screenshot is done so to supplement the text. If the UI changes and important steps are only documented with images, the user might not be able to follow the instructions.

## The Octopus Web Portal

The Octopus UI has a light theme and a dark theme. We want our readers to have a consistent experience across our site when they see images of the UI. Unless you are specifically discussing the dark mode theme, use light mode for screenshots of the Octopus Web Portal.
