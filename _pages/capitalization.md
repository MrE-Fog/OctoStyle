title:Capitalization
---

As a general rule, capitalize words and terms that are proper nouns. If you're uncertain, default to not capitalizing terms.

In terms of Octopus this means capitalizing product names, tool names, and the names of features, but not general concepts.

The following are capitalized:

- Octopus Server
- Octopus Cloud
- Workers
- Spaces
- Operations Runbooks

The following are not capitalized (unless at the start of a sentence):

- Deployment target
- Environment 
- Server
- Built-in repository
- Runbooks (the concept as opposed to the feature)
