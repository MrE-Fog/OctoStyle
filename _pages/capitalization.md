As a general rule, capitalize words and terms that are proper nouns or would normally be capitalized. If you're uncertain, default to not capitalizing terms.

For Octopus, this means capitalizing product names, tool names, and the names of features, but not general concepts.

The following are capitalized:

- Octopus Server
- Octopus Cloud
- Workers
- Spaces
- Operations Runbooks

The following are not capitalized (unless at the start of a sentence):

- deployment target
- environment 
- server
- built-in repository
- runbooks (the concept not the feature)

## Match the UI

The only exception to the rule is to use the same style as the UI you're documenting. For instance, deployment target is not a proper and should not normally be capitalized, however, if you are instructing a user to click a UI element in the web portal and UI label is capitalized or all caps, you should mirror the style from the UI.

## Titles

Titles are written in sentence case, and only words that are normally capitalized are capitalized in titles.
